# Claw-Empire v1.1.0 Release Notes

- Release date: 2026-02-21
- Scope: PR #19 merge consolidation, Task Board visibility controls expansion, and Skills Learn/Unlearn workflow hardening across UI and backend.

## Highlights

- **Task Board Hide + View Controls**
  - Added a toolbar `Hide` button to the left of `New Task` for quick status-based hiding.
  - Bulk hide now supports `Done`, `Pending (Hold)`, and `Cancelled` statuses in one action.
  - Added a compact `Active / All` visibility toggle (localized as `진행중 / 모두보기`) so hidden tasks can be included or excluded instantly.
  - Hidden state remains persisted and is filtered safely when task statuses change.

- **Skills Learn UX Upgrades**
  - Skill cards now display up to four learned providers in a compact 2x2 indicator (CLI icon + representative agent avatar).
  - Learn modal shows `Learned` for already learned providers (without trailing period).
  - Already learned providers are unchecked by default to prevent duplicate learning runs.
  - Modal close/ESC protection while learning is running to prevent accidental interruption.

- **Skills Memory + Unlearn Experience**
  - Learning Memory tab now shows the latest 3 records by default with expand/collapse for full history.
  - Added unlearn actions in both history and available-skill lists.
  - Added playful unlearn feedback animation (pot/hammer hit + `Bonk!` center overlay).
  - Unlearn refresh sync keeps skills cards and memory lists aligned after removal.

- **Cross-Platform Unlearn Execution Hardening**
  - Added/updated `POST /api/skills/unlearn` flow with provider/repo validation and structured CLI attempt metadata.
  - Uses platform-aware command dispatch (`npx` on macOS/Linux, `npx.cmd` on Windows).
  - Adds filesystem-based verification for linked skill state before considering unlearn complete.
  - Deletes succeeded learning-history records only after successful CLI unlearn outcome.

- **Documentation Alignment (CLI/OAuth/API)**
  - Updated README language packs (EN/KO/JP/ZH) so intro/provider sections match current multi-provider architecture.
  - Clarified that skills learn/unlearn automation currently targets CLI-capable providers.

## Notes

- Task bulk-hide targets are mapped to status values `done`, `pending`, and `cancelled`.
- If a provider has no locally verifiable skill directory, unlearn can return a skipped success with explanatory CLI metadata.
- `skills-lock.json` remains tracked by design for skill-state coordination.
